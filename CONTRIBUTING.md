# Contributing to the Open WebUI Helm Charts

## How to Contribute

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently a bug in the Helm Chart Releaser Github Action that prevents you from deploying more than one chart on a single run. The best workaround for now is to ensure that pushes to `main` only include changes to a single chart. If you're contributing to more than one chart, please do it in separate PRs until the upstream issue is fixed, or until we can fork and fix the action ourselves. 

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** and ensure they follow the guidelines below.
3. **Test your changes** locally to ensure everything works as expected. This should include deploying your updates to a live Kubernetes cluster (whether local or remote).
4. **Run helm-docs** to ensure that the README is updated with the latest changes. 
5. **Commit your changes** using a descriptive commit message that follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
6. **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
7. **Create a Pull Request** and provide a detailed description of your changes. Please consider dropping us your redacted `values.yaml` file used during your testing in the PR so we can make sure we see consistent results. 

## Guidelines

- **Semantic Versioning**: This repository follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning the Helm Charts. When making changes, please ensure that you update the version in the `Chart.yaml` file according to the following rules:
  - `MAJOR` version increment for incompatible chart changes
  - `MINOR` version increment for backwards-compatible functionality additions
  - `PATCH` version increment for backwards-compatible bug fixes

- **Chart.yaml Updates**: When submitting a Pull Request, ensure that you have updated the `Chart.yaml` file with the appropriate version increment and a brief description of the changes in the `appVersion` field.

- **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the repository.

- **Documentation**: If your changes require documentation updates, please include them in your Pull Request.

- **Testing**: Before submitting your Pull Request, ensure that your changes work as expected by testing them locally. This should include deploying your updates to a live Kubernetes cluster (whether local or remote).

- **Issues**: If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create a new issue in the repository before working on a Pull Request.

- **Actions Updates**: If your Pull Request includes adding a new chart dependency, ensure to make the necessary updates to Github Actions to add the chart repo dependency, or else the release run will fail.
